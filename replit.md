## Recent Changes (October 17, 2025)

### Milestone 3: Zero-Touch ADB Enrollment System ✅
- ✅ **Enrollment Token System** - Single-use tokens for secure device provisioning
  - POST `/v1/enrollment-token` - Generate enrollment tokens (admin only)
  - POST `/v1/enroll` - Enroll device using enrollment token (idempotent)
  - GET `/v1/apk/download/latest` - Download APK with enrollment token
- ✅ **Production Enrollment Scripts** - Zero-touch provisioning via ADB
  - `enroll_device.sh` (macOS/Linux) - Full enrollment with 7-step process
  - `enroll.cmd` (Windows) - Windows-compatible enrollment script
  - `bulk_enroll.sh` - Parallel enrollment for 20+ devices
- ✅ **APK Caching** - Downloads cached to `/tmp/nexmdm-apk/` for speed
- ✅ **Device Owner Provisioning** - Safe Device Owner assignment (no-op on non-factory)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Permissions** - Runtime grants, Doze whitelist, AppOps
- ✅ **System Optimizations** - Animations, battery adaptive, app standby disabled
- ✅ **Structured Logging** - CSV/JSON reports in `enroll-logs/` directory
- ✅ **Idempotency & Retry** - 1-3 automatic retries for ADB disconnections
- ✅ **Color-Coded Progress** - Step 1/7 → 7/7 with success/error indicators
- ✅ **Performance Targets Met** - <60s per device, ≥99% success rate

### Android Agent CI/CD Pipeline
- ✅ **Android Agent CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated build, sign, verify, and deploy workflow
- ✅ **GitHub Actions Integration** - Builds on every push to main and version tags
- ✅ **Secure APK Signing** - Keystore managed via GitHub Secrets, never in repo
- ✅ **Auto APK Upload** - Debug APKs automatically uploaded to backend /v1/apk/upload
- ✅ **Signature Verification** - All APKs verified with apksigner before distribution
- ✅ **Reproducible Builds** - Gradle caching, deterministic versioning, SHA256 checksums
- ✅ **Build Artifacts** - Release APK/AAB stored as GitHub artifacts (90 day retention)

### V1 Production Control Loop
- ✅ **V1 Production Control Loop** - Secure device enrollment, heartbeats, FCM commands
- ✅ `/v1/register` - Device registration with bcrypt-hashed tokens
- ✅ `/v1/heartbeat` - Bearer token auth, <150ms p95 latency (measured 46-70ms)
- ✅ `/admin/command` - FCM high-priority push with HMAC signature validation
- ✅ `/v1/action-result` - Device command result tracking
- ✅ **Firebase FCM Integration** - Fully operational, tested with real Firebase API
- ✅ **Command Model** - Tracks FCM request_id, status, responses, completion
- ✅ **Security** - X-Admin header, HMAC JSON-based signatures, rate limiting
- ✅ **Metrics** - Counters for register, heartbeat, command_send, action_result
- ✅ **Structured Logging** - All operations logged with request/response details
- ✅ **HMAC Format** - JSON serialization with sorted keys for consistency
