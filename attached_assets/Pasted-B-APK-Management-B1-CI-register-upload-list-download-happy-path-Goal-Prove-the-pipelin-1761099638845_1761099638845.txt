B) APK Management
B1. CI → register → upload → list → download (happy path)

Goal: Prove the pipeline end-to-end.

Steps

Trigger CI to build app-debug.apk.

CI calls:

POST /admin/apk/register (metadata).

POST /admin/apk/upload (multipart APK file).

FE loads APK Management → sees the new build.

Click Download.

Expected

Register returns 200; Upload returns 200 with storage://… key.

Build visible in FE with correct version, size, time.

Download returns file with matching size/hash.

Evidence

API responses (IDs), FE screenshot, file size check, logs apk.register & storage.upload.success.

B2. Device “latest” (debug)

Goal: Verify device path uses the same storage and auth.

Steps

Call GET /v1/apk/download-latest?build_type=debug using an enrollment token (or a device token if supported).

Save the response; check bytes.

Expected

200 OK, correct bytes, no 401/403.

Server logs apk.download {source: device} and increments apk_download_total{source=device}.

Evidence

File saved; logs; counter increments.

B3. Duplicate register policy

Goal: Ensure idempotency or clear errors on duplicate version codes.

Steps

Call POST /admin/apk/register twice with same (build_type, version_code) but different git sha.

Expected (choose one policy)

Upsert: second call updates metadata and returns 200 with note.

Reject: 409 with duplicate_version_code.

Evidence

Response + logs apk.register show consistent policy; no ghost rows.

B4. Invalid file type / oversized upload

Goal: Enforce constraints.

Steps

Upload .txt or .zip to /admin/apk/upload.

Upload a file > max size (e.g., 100 MB).

Expected

415 (unsupported media type) or 422 with clear error.

413 Payload Too Large for oversize; no partial artifacts left in storage.

Evidence

Errors; storage listing shows no garbage; logs storage.upload.error.

B5. Storage sidecar regression (simulate)

Goal: Backend fails gracefully if Replit Storage is unavailable.

Steps

Temporarily disable App Storage in Replit UI (or kill sidecar if possible).

Attempt /admin/apk/upload.

Expected

503 with storage_unavailable error code; no DB row created or linked to missing file.

On re-enable, uploads succeed without code changes.

Evidence

Error response + logs; re-trial success.

B6. Admin download vs device download

Goal: Admin UI uses the correct scoped route, and devices use token-guarded route.

Steps

Try /admin/apk/download/{build_id} without admin scope.

Try /v1/apk/download-latest without enrollment/device token.

Expected

403 on admin route; 401 on device route.

With correct credentials, both work.

Evidence

HTTP status codes; logs sec.scope.denied for admin miss.

B7. Rollback safety (optional)

Goal: A bad build shouldn’t break device path.

Steps

Register/upload a new “bad” build; then immediately “rollback” (un-promote).

Device calls /v1/agent/update (if implemented) or /v1/apk/download-latest.

Expected

Device receives previous safe build or no update.

No 404s pointing at missing builds.

Evidence

Logs and response from device endpoint.

B8. Metrics & logs integrity

Goal: Counters/logs must reflect real actions.

Steps

Do 3 registers, 2 uploads, 4 admin downloads, 5 device downloads.

Scrape /metrics.

Expected

apk_builds_total +3

storage_uploads_total +2

apk_download_total{source=admin} +4

apk_download_total{source=device} +5

Timestamps in logs match actions; no gaps.

Evidence

/metrics snapshot; log extracts with request_id.

Exit criteria (green = done)

Monitoring: Up → Down → Recover works, deduped alerts, no flapping, correct thresholds, “Unknown” handled.

APK Mgmt: CI publish, admin/device downloads work; invalid uploads rejected; storage failures handled gracefully; metrics/logs consistent.

No secrets in logs; UI states accurate; performance is snappy.
