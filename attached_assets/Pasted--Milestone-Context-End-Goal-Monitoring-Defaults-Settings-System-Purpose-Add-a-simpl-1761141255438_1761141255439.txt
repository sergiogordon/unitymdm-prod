**Milestone Context & End Goal — Monitoring Defaults (Settings → System)**

**Purpose:**
Add a simple, global way to configure which app to monitor (by package), the UI alias, the “consider down after” threshold, and whether monitoring is enabled globally. These **defaults** apply to new devices at registration (and as a fallback for devices without per-device overrides).

---

### What “done” means

**Settings UI (new card: “Monitoring Defaults”)**

* Fields:

  * **Monitored package** (text) — e.g., `com.unitynetwork.unityapp`
  * **Display name (alias)** (text) — e.g., `Speedtest` or `Unity`
  * **Foreground timeout (minutes)** (number) — default **10**, clamp 1–120
  * **Enable monitoring globally** (toggle) — default **ON**
* Buttons: **Save**, **Cancel**.
* Shows current saved values; toasts on success/error.

**Backend (persistent org-level defaults)**

* Endpoints:

  * `GET /admin/settings/monitoring-defaults` →
    `{ "enabled": true, "package": "com.unitynetwork.unityapp", "alias": "Speedtest", "threshold_min": 10, "updated_at": "…" }`
  * `PATCH /admin/settings/monitoring-defaults` (scope: `device_manage`) → same shape, partial updates allowed.
* Persistence: single-row `settings` record (or dedicated `monitoring_defaults` table/kv).
* Validation: package regex, threshold bounds, alias length ≤ 64.

**Propagation & evaluation**

* **On device registration:** if device has no explicit per-device monitoring settings, seed them from these defaults.
* **On heartbeat/evaluation:** if a device has no per-device override, evaluator uses **global defaults**.
* **Per-device override precedence:** per-device settings > global defaults. (No automatic overwrite on global changes.)

**Alerts & status**

* Evaluator treats devices without overrides as governed by the global toggle & threshold.
* Discord “Service Down” alert text uses **display alias** (falls back to package).

---

### Non-goals (for this milestone)

* No per-device editing UX changes (that remains as is).
* No bulk apply/force-overwrite existing devices.
* No auto-remediation toggles.
* No enrollment UI; ADB setup remains the path.

---

### Security

* `GET`/`PATCH` require admin key with `device_manage` scope.
* Inputs sanitized and validated; changes audited.
* No secrets stored.

---

### Observability

* Events: `settings.monitoring_defaults.read|update` (include admin_id, changed fields).
* Evaluator logs include which source was used: `{source:"global"|"device"}`.
* Gauges: `service_down_devices_gauge` unaffected by this change except through new config.

---

### Performance & reliability targets

* `GET`/`PATCH` p95 < 80 ms.
* Registration path reads defaults without extra queries (cached or single lookup).
* Evaluator uses cached defaults (refresh on change) to avoid per-heartbeat DB hits.

---

### Acceptance tests

**API**

1. `GET /admin/settings/monitoring-defaults` (fresh env) → returns built-in defaults `{enabled:true, package:"com.unitynetwork.unityapp", alias:"Speedtest", threshold_min:10}`.
2. `PATCH` with `{ alias:"Unity", package:"com.unity.app", threshold_min:12, enabled:true }` → `200`; `GET` reflects updates.
3. Invalid inputs (threshold 0, alias >64, bad package) → `422` with clear error.

**Propagation**
4. Register a new device with no overrides → device settings seeded from updated defaults; evaluator uses them; device shows **Service: Up/Down** accordingly.
5. Existing device with per-device override remains unchanged after defaults update; evaluator uses **device** settings.

**Evaluator/alerts**
6. With global defaults enabled, device without override sends heartbeat with `monitored_foreground_recent_s=900` and threshold 10 → **Down** → Discord alert fires once; recovery on foreground.

**UI**
7. Open Settings → “Monitoring Defaults” shows current values.
8. Edit and Save → toast success; reopening shows persisted values.
9. Toggle “Enable monitoring globally” OFF → devices without overrides show **Service: Disabled** (or hide status), no alerts generated.

### Definition of Done

* Settings drawer has a **Monitoring Defaults** card with the four fields above.
* Backend stores and serves these defaults via `GET/PATCH /admin/settings/monitoring-defaults`.
* New devices inherit defaults on registration; devices without overrides are evaluated using these defaults.
* Alerts and UI labels use the alias; package drives detection; threshold honored (10 min by default).
* Tests above pass and logs/metrics reflect reads/updates of monitoring defaults.
