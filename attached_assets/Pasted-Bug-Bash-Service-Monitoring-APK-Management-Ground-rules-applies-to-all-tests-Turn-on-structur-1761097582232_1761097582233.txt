Bug Bash — Service Monitoring + APK Management
Ground rules (applies to all tests)

Turn on structured logs and keep the console open.

Note request_id for every API call you make.

Snapshot /metrics before and after critical tests.

Label bugs with Severity (Blocker, High, Medium, Low) and include:

Title, Area (Monitoring|Alerts|APK Mgmt|Agent|CI), Repro, Expected vs Actual, Logs (request_id), Suspected Root Cause, Fix rec, Regression test.

A) Configurable Service Uptime Monitoring + Discord Alerts
A1. Happy path: service stays up

Goal: Verify “Up” status when the monitored package has been foregrounded within threshold.

Steps

In Device Settings → Monitoring set:
monitor_enabled=true, monitored_package=io.unitynodes.unityapp, monitored_display_name="Speedtest", monitored_threshold_min=10.

On device, put Speedtest in foreground briefly; then background it.

Send heartbeat with monitored_foreground_recent_s=120 (2min).

Expected

UI shows Service: Up, Last Foreground ≈ 2m.

No Discord alert.

Logs: monitoring.service_up with device_id, package, threshold.

Evidence

Screenshot device details; structured log snippet; /metrics diff (service_down_devices_gauge unchanged).

A2. Down transition + alert (dedupe)

Goal: Detect “Down” after threshold and send exactly one alert, with recovery on return.

Steps

Send two heartbeats 5 min apart with monitored_foreground_recent_s ≥ 900 (≥15m).
(Simulates “not in foreground ≥ threshold” twice).

Wait alert evaluator tick (≤60s).

Bring app to foreground; heartbeat with monitored_foreground_recent_s=20.

Expected

First “Down” transition triggers one Discord alert (no spam).

Status flips to Service: Down then back to Up after last heartbeat.

Recovery message sent once.

Cooldown respected (no repeated alerts while still down).

Evidence

Discord messages (down + recovery), alert.service_down.raise|recover logs with same device_id, cooldown not violated.

A3. Unknown state (missing usage access)

Goal: Ensure we don’t misfire alerts when agent can’t measure.

Steps

Remove Usage Access for the agent (manually or ADB).

Heartbeat with monitored_foreground_recent_s = null.

Expected

UI shows Service: Unknown.

No alert fired.

Log: usage_access_missing or equivalent; evaluator skips alert.

Evidence

Device page screenshot; logs; absence of new Discord messages.

A4. Threshold change live update

Goal: Changing threshold applies immediately.

Steps

With “Down” condition active, change monitored_threshold_min from 10 → 5.

Next heartbeat still shows monitored_foreground_recent_s=600 (10m).

Expected

Evaluator uses 5-minute threshold immediately; device remains Down.

No duplicate “Down” alert (state unchanged).

Recovery requires foreground event <5min.

Evidence

monitoring.update log; no duplicate alert.

A5. Monitor toggle off/on

Goal: Disabling monitoring cancels alerts and hides state.

Steps

Set monitor_enabled=false.

Send heartbeat with big value, e.g., monitored_foreground_recent_s=3600.

Re-enable, send normal heartbeat.

Expected

While disabled: no status badge, no alerts.

When re-enabled: evaluator resumes; state recomputed on next heartbeat.

Evidence

UI states before/after; logs show no alert.service_down while disabled.

A6. UI-only alias (rename service)

Goal: Renaming “display name” doesn’t affect monitoring logic.

Steps

Change monitored_display_name from “Speedtest” → “Unity (Staging)”.

Do not change monitored_package.

Expected

UI label updates.

Detection unchanged (still tied to package).

Alerts show new alias in message.

Evidence

Screenshot + Discord message text includes new alias.

A7. Bulk edit (optional) / 50 devices smoke

Goal: Ensure list views scale.

Steps

Apply monitoring settings to 50 devices (script or API).

Drive 10 devices to “Down”.

Expected

Devices table filters: service:down shows 10; performance OK.

Exactly 10 alerts (or one roll-up if configured).

Evidence

Counters: service_down_alerts_total increased by expected value; no FE lag.

A8. Race conditions / noisy agent

Goal: No alert flapping.

Steps

Alternate heartbeats: monitored_foreground_recent_s=590 then 610 every minute with threshold=10min.

Run for 15 min.

Expected

At most one “Down” alert and one recovery (if you cross boundary once).

Cooldown + state tracking prevent flapping.

Evidence

Logs show no alert storm; Discord quiet except single transitions.
