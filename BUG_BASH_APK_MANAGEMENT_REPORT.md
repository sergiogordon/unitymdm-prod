# Bug Bash Report: APK Management
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Test Suite:** APK Management (B1-B8)  
**Tester:** Automated Test Suite  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - Critical Backend Stability Issues

---

## Executive Summary

APK Management bug bash testing was **BLOCKED** due to critical backend stability issues discovered during test execution. While Service Monitoring tests achieved 85.7% pass rate with excellent Discord alert delivery, APK Management testing revealed severe runtime errors that prevent proper validation of the CI-to-device APK pipeline.

### Results Overview
- **Completed Tests:** 1/8 (12.5%)
- **Blocked Tests:** 7/8 (87.5%)
- **Critical Bugs Found:** 3
- **Severity:** HIGH - Blocks production deployment

## Critical Bugs Discovered

### üêõ BUG #1: Backend Crashes on Multipart Upload Requests (CRITICAL)
**Severity:** P0 - BLOCKER  
**Component:** `/admin/apk/upload` endpoint  
**Impact:** Complete failure of APK upload functionality

**Description:**
The backend crashes immediately when processing multipart/form-data upload requests. The validation error handler attempts to read the request body after it's already been consumed by the multipart parser, causing a `RuntimeError: Stream consumed` exception that crashes the entire backend process.

**Error Trace:**
```
RuntimeError: Stream consumed
  File "server/main.py", line 351, in validation_exception_handler
    body = await request.body()
  File "starlette/requests.py", line 242, in body
    raise RuntimeError("Stream consumed")
```

**Root Cause:**
The `validation_exception_handler` in `server/main.py` (line 347-359) unconditionally attempts to read `request.body()` for logging purposes. For multipart/form-data requests, the stream has already been consumed by FastAPI's form parser, making a second read operation impossible.

**Reproduction:**
1. Start backend server
2. Send POST request to `/admin/apk/upload` with multipart/form-data
3. Backend crashes with stream consumed error
4. All subsequent requests fail with connection refused

**Recommended Fix:**
```python
@app.exception_handler(RequestValidationError)
async def validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError):
    print(f"[VALIDATION ERROR] {request.url.path}")
    
    # Skip body logging for multipart requests - stream already consumed
    content_type = request.headers.get("content-type", "")
    if not content_type.startswith("multipart"):
        try:
            body = await request.body()
            print(f"[VALIDATION ERROR] Body: {body[:500]}")
        except RuntimeError:
            print(f"[VALIDATION ERROR] Body: <stream consumed>")
    
    print(f"[VALIDATION ERROR] Errors: {exc.errors()}")
    return JSONResponse(status_code=422, content={"detail": exc.errors()})
```

### üêõ BUG #2: Upload Endpoint Form Parameter Mismatch (HIGH)
**Severity:** P1 - HIGH  
**Component:** `/admin/apk/upload` API contract  
**Impact:** Confusing API design, integration failures

**Description:**
The `/admin/apk/upload` endpoint requires metadata fields (`build_id`, `version_code`, `version_name`, `build_type`) to be sent as Form data alongside the file, but this is not documented in the API specification. Initial test attempts using query parameters failed validation.

**Expected Behavior:**
```python
# Unclear from API docs - should it be query params or form data?
POST /admin/apk/upload?build_id=123&version_code=101
```

**Actual Requirement:**
```python
# Must send as multipart form fields
POST /admin/apk/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"
<binary APK data>
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="build_id"
123
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="version_code"
101
```

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Document the multipart form requirements clearly in API spec
2. Consider accepting metadata via query parameters OR form data for flexibility
3. Add example curl/requests code to documentation

### üêõ BUG #3: Backend Process Instability (CRITICAL)
**Severity:** P0 - BLOCKER  
**Component:** FastAPI application startup/runtime  
**Impact:** Unpredictable service availability

**Description:**
The backend process exhibits severe instability, randomly crashing during normal operation even after successful startup. Crashes occur when:
- Processing validation errors (see Bug #1)
- Handling concurrent requests
- Running for extended periods

**Observed Behavior:**
```
INFO: Application startup complete.
[... 30 seconds later ...]
ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused
```

Process dies without error messages in logs, suggesting:
- Unhandled exception in async context
- Resource exhaustion (memory/file descriptors)
- Database connection pool issues
- Event loop corruption

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Add comprehensive exception handlers for all async routes
2. Implement health check endpoint with database connectivity test
3. Add process monitoring and auto-restart (e.g., supervisor, systemd)
4. Review async/await patterns for potential deadlocks
5. Add structured logging for all uncaught exceptions

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Completed Tests

#### B3: Duplicate Register Policy
**Status:** ‚úÖ PASS  
**Evidence:** System correctly upserts duplicate `version_code` registrations
```json
{
  "first_registration": {"build_id": 19, "version_code": 102},
  "second_registration": {"build_id": 19, "version_code": 102},
  "policy": "upsert"
}
```

**Notes:** The system handles duplicate registrations gracefully by updating the existing build record rather than creating duplicates or rejecting the request. This is the correct behavior for CI systems that may retry uploads.

**Status:** ‚ùå BLOCKED by Bug #1

- Device route authorization NOT tested due to backend instability

#### B7: Rollback Safety
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT TESTED

}
```

2. Add end-to-end APK upload test to CI pipeline
3. Review all error handlers for stream consumption issues
4. Implement circuit breaker pattern for Object Storage calls

### Long-term (P2)
1. Add observability: APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
2. Implement graceful degradation for storage failures
3. Add rate limiting for upload endpoints
4. Create comprehensive API documentation with examples

### Test Artifacts
- Full test suite: `server/tests/bug_bash_apk_management.py`
- Quick test script: `server/tests/quick_apk_test.py`
- Service monitoring report: `BUG_BASH_MONITORING_REPORT.md`

### Environment
- Backend: FastAPI with uvicorn
- Storage: Replit Object Storage SDK
- Database: PostgreSQL (Neon)
- Python: 3.11.13

### Related Issues
- Service Monitoring tests achieved 85.7% pass rate
- Discord alert system working perfectly (100% delivery)
- Database operations stable and performant

---

## Conclusion

While the Service Monitoring feature demonstrated production-ready quality with 85.7% test pass rate and perfect Discord alert delivery, the APK Management system revealed critical stability issues that **block production deployment**.

The most severe issue is the backend crash on multipart uploads (Bug #1), which makes the entire APK distribution pipeline non-functional. This must be resolved before any APK management features can be reliably tested or deployed.

**Recommendation:** Fix Bug #1 immediately, then re-run full bug bash test suite to validate remaining scenarios (B2, B4, B5, B7, B8).
