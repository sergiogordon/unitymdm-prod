# UNITYmdm - Lightweight Mobile Device Management

A modern, self-hosted Mobile Device Management (MDM) system for monitoring and remotely controlling Android 13+ devices. Built specifically for managing fleets of dedicated devices with real-time monitoring, remote control, and fleet-wide app deployment.

[![Deploy on Replit](https://replit.com/badge)](https://replit.com/@SergioGordon/UNITYmdm?v=1)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice for Unity Users

### Current System Status
All core functionality is **fully operational** including real-time monitoring, Discord alerts, device management, remote screen streaming, APK deployment, and fleet controls. However, **remote battery whitelist application** is currently limited due to Android security restrictions.

### Android Version Compatibility
**‚úÖ Tested and optimized for Android 13+ (API 33) devices.** The system works on other Android versions, but you may need to customize battery optimization for your specific devices.

**Have Different Android Versions?** Just ask Replit Agent to adapt it for you:

**Example Prompts:**
- üí¨ *"Adapt this system for Android 12 devices"*
- üí¨ *"My Samsung Galaxy phones are running Android 11 - update the battery optimization to work with them"*
- üí¨ *"Change the minimum Android version to Android 8 so I can use older phones"*
- üí¨ *"The ADB script isn't working on my Motorola phones - fix the battery whitelist commands for Android 14"*

**That's it!** Replit Agent will automatically update the Android app configuration, battery optimization code, and ADB enrollment script to match your devices. No need to understand file paths or technical details.

**Core features (monitoring, APK deployment) work across all Android versions unchanged.**

### Battery Whitelist Limitation
- ‚úÖ **ADB (Android Debug Bridge) Enrollment Script**: Successfully applies battery whitelist during initial device setup
- ‚ùå **Remote Application via FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)**: Not possible without root access (Android security prevents Device Owner apps from executing privileged shell commands)
- üì± **Current Testing**: Uses Speedtest app as example; works perfectly when enrolled via ADB

### Deployment Options for Unity Users

**Option 1: Deploy Now (Recommended for Testing)**
- Fork and deploy UNITYmdm today to test all features with Speedtest
- When Unity APK becomes available:
  - Upload the Unity APK to your dashboard
  - Replit Agent will auto-update your ADB script with Unity package
  - Enroll new devices with battery whitelist automatically configured
- **Best for**: Users who want to test the system immediately and enroll Unity devices later

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important for Option 1 Users:**
- **Start with a few test devices first** - Don't deploy to your entire fleet immediately
- **When Unity APK is released**, you'll need to use ADB to configure battery optimization for Unity:
  - Unity must be set to **"Restricted"** battery mode to prevent Android's Doze/Battery Manager from killing the Unity service
  - This cannot be done remotely via FCM due to Android security restrictions
  - You'll need physical USB access to run the updated ADB enrollment script for Unity-specific battery optimization
- **Test thoroughly** with Speedtest before committing to Unity deployment

**Option 2: Wait for Unity APK**
- Wait until Unity APK is publicly available
- **This repo will be updated the same day Unity APK is released** with:
  - Unity APK included and ready to deploy
  - Pre-configured ADB script with battery whitelist for Unity
- Fork and deploy with Unity support ready out-of-the-box
- **Best for**: Users who only need Unity monitoring and can wait

### Important: Fork Independence
**‚ö†Ô∏è Once you fork/deploy this Repl, you won't receive automatic updates from this repository.** Each fork is an independent copy. While manual updates are technically possible via Git, they risk:
- Merge conflicts with your customizations
- Database schema breaking changes
- Configuration incompatibilities

**To get updates:** You'll need to fork the latest version fresh and manually migrate your settings/data.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, gather these requirements to ensure a smooth deployment:

### Required Setup
- ‚úÖ **Replit Account** - [Sign up free](https://replit.com/signup) (deployment platform)
- ‚úÖ **Firebase Project** - [Create project](https://console.firebase.google.com) (push notifications)
  - Download service account JSON file (needed for secrets)
  - Enable Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- ‚úÖ **Android Device(s)** - Android 13+ with USB debugging enabled
- ‚úÖ **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** - Required for device enrollment
  - Mac: `brew install android-platform-tools`
  - Windows: [Download Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)
  - Linux: `sudo apt install adb`

### Optional (But Recommended)
- üîî **Discord Webhook** - For device offline/battery alerts ([setup guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668))
- üõ†Ô∏è **GitHub Account** - For automated APK builds ([sign up](https://github.com/signup))

### Time Investment (First-Time Setup)

**Total: ~25-30 minutes** (breakdown below)

| Step | Time | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| Fork & Initial Setup | 5 min | Fork Repl, enable PostgreSQL |
| Firebase Configuration | 5-10 min | Create project, download JSON, enable FCM |
| Configure Secrets | 5 min | Add ADMIN_KEY, Firebase JSON, SERVER_URL |
| **APK Building** | **5-10 min** | **See details below** |
| First Device Enrollment | 3-5 min | Connect via USB, run ADB script |

**Subsequent enrollments**: ~30 seconds per device (bulk script)

### What to Expect

**Most Complex Step: Building the Android APK**

The APK build is the only technical hurdle, but we've made it as easy as possible:

**üéØ Option 1 (Recommended): GitHub Actions - Fully Automated**
- ‚úÖ Pre-configured workflow already included in this repo
- ‚úÖ Zero Android Studio or local setup required
- ‚úÖ Build happens in the cloud automatically

**Setup once (5-10 minutes):**
1. Connect your Repl to GitHub (Replit's built-in Git integration)
2. Add 3 GitHub Secrets (Firebase JSON, signing keys)
3. Push code ‚Üí APK builds and uploads to your dashboard automatically!

**After setup:** Every code change auto-builds APK and deploys to your dashboard.

**üì± Option 2: Manual Build with Android Studio**
- Requires Android Studio installation (~5GB download)
- Manual signing key generation
- Local APK compilation and upload
- Only use if GitHub Actions isn't an option

**Everything else is straightforward**: The rest of the deployment is copying/pasting credentials and clicking buttons. No coding or terminal commands required.

### Cost Breakdown
- **Replit Core**: $20/month (includes $25 credits monthly) - Required for 24/7 public deployment
- **Firebase**: Free tier (sufficient for 100+ devices)
- **Discord**: Free
- **GitHub Actions**: Free (2,000 build minutes/month included)
- **Total**: **~$20/month** (or $0 if Replit credits cover usage)

**üí° Pro Tips:**
- Test on Replit's **free tier first** - Works great for local development/testing
- Upgrade to **Core only when ready** for public deployment with custom domain
- Replit's $25/month credit usually **covers the $20 Core subscription**, making it effectively free if you don't exceed limits

---

## üé® Customizing with Replit Agent

**No technical skills needed!** Instead of manually editing code files, just tell Replit Agent what you want to change. It will automatically update the right files for you. I suggest trying / testing with 1 device if you have older or newer devices first and see if the compatability works with the current deployment or not -- then make changes if needed. 

### Common Customization Examples

**Android Compatibility:**
- üí¨ *"Adapt this for Android 12 devices instead of Android 13"*
- üí¨ *"My phones are running Android 11 - update the battery optimization code"*

**Carrier/Device Specific:** (Not necessary - but nice to have)
- üí¨ *"Update the ADB script to remove AT&T bloatware phones instead of Verizon"* 
- üí¨ *"Disable Samsung bloatware instead of generic Android apps"*
- üí¨ *"The script isn't working on my Motorola devices - fix the battery whitelist commands"*

**Feature Customization:**
- üí¨ *"Change the heartbeat interval from 5 minutes to 10 minutes"*
- üí¨ *"Lower the battery alert threshold from 15% to 10%"*
- üí¨ *"Send email alerts instead of Discord notifications"*
- üí¨ *"Monitor a different app package instead of Speedtest"*

**Dashboard Changes:**
- üí¨ *"Add a widget showing average device temperature"*
- üí¨ *"Change the offline threshold from 15 minutes to 30 minutes"*
- üí¨ *"Add a dark mode toggle to the dashboard"*

**That's it!** Replit Agent handles all the technical details - finding the right files, making the changes, and testing them. No need to understand code or file structures.

## üì¶ Bulk Device Enrollment

Enrolling multiple devices? UNITYmdm makes it easy to onboard 10, 50, or 100+ devices efficiently with CSV-based bulk enrollment.

### How Bulk Enrollment Works (If the below is confusing - just ask Replit agent to do it for you :)  )

1. **Create a Device List** - Make a `devices.csv` file with your device names:
   ```csv
   alias,unity_package
   RackA-01,com.speedtest.androidspeedtest
   RackA-02,com.speedtest.androidspeedtest
   PhoneFarm-D01,com.speedtest.androidspeedtest
   Warehouse-K1,com.yourapp.package
   ```
   
   **üìÑ Quick Start**: Copy the template: `cp scripts/devices.csv.example scripts/devices.csv`

2. **Run the Bulk Script** - Automates enrollment for each device:
   ```bash
   export SERVER_URL="https://your-app.repl.co"
   export ADMIN_KEY="your-admin-key"
   cd scripts
   ./bulk_enroll.sh
   ```

3. **Connect Each Device** - The script pauses between devices:
   - Connect device via USB
   - Press Enter to enroll
   - Disconnect and connect next device
   - Repeat

### Device Naming Best Practices

Choose a naming convention that scales:

| Pattern | Example | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Sequential** | `D01`, `D02`, `D03` | Simple numbering, easy to track |
| **Location-Based** | `NYC-Office-K1`, `Chicago-Warehouse-D05` | Geographic distribution |
| **Rack/Position** | `Rack1-Shelf2-D07`, `Cabinet-A-Phone-12` | Physical organization |
| **MAC-Based** | `Phone-A4F2` (last 4 of MAC) | Guaranteed uniqueness |

**üí° Pro Tip**: Aliases can be edited anytime in the dashboard! Start with simple names like D01-D50, then rename later based on actual deployment.

### Automation Options

**Semi-Automated (Default)**
- Interactive prompts between devices
- Safe for manual cable swapping
- Good for 10-50 devices

**Fully Automated (Advanced)**
- Edit `bulk_enroll.sh` to remove `read` prompts
- Use USB hubs for simultaneous connections
- Ideal for 100+ device deployments

### Example Workflows

**Scenario 1: Phone Farm (50 devices)**
```bash
# Generate CSV with D01 through D50
for i in {1..50}; do
  printf "D%02d,com.speedtest.androidspeedtest\n" $i >> devices.csv
done

# Run bulk enrollment
./bulk_enroll.sh
# Connect devices via USB hub, press Enter for each
```
```
Deploy with location-aware names, monitor by region in dashboard.

**Scenario 2: Rename After Deployment**
1. Enroll quickly as D01, D02, D03...
2. Deploy to physical locations
3. Edit aliases in dashboard: D01 ‚Üí "MainEntrance-Kiosk", D02 ‚Üí "Lobby-Display"

üìñ **Detailed walkthrough**: See [DEPLOYMENT.md - Bulk Enrollment](DEPLOYMENT.md) for step-by-step guide with screenshots.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: Is UNITYmdm right for my use case?**

UNITYmdm is specifically designed for managing **physical Android devices spread across different locations** that need remote management without requiring a PC or physical access.

**Perfect for:**
- üì± Physical phones/tablets deployed in multiple locations (homes, warehouses, offices)
- üåê Remote fleet management without USB access
- üîÑ Internet-connected devices that need OTA (over-the-air) updates
- üí∞ Cost-effective scaling (10 to 1000+ devices)

**How it works:**
UNITYmdm leverages **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for remote control:
- ‚úÖ **No physical access needed** - Deploy APKs, restart devices, change settings from anywhere
- ‚úÖ **Internet-based control** - Works as long as devices have WiFi/cellular connectivity
- ‚úÖ **Real-time** - Instant push notifications vs. waiting for devices to poll
- ‚úÖ **Scalable** - Manage your entire fleet from a laptop

**Not the best fit for:**
- üñ•Ô∏è **SIM box farms or USB-connected setups** - If your devices are permanently connected to a PC, USB-based tools may be simpler
- üîå **Local-only management** - If you have physical access and prefer wired control
- üì∂ **Offline devices** - UNITYmdm requires internet connectivity for remote features

**Bottom line:** If you have physical devices in different locations and need to manage them remotely without traveling or USB cables, UNITYmdm is built for your use case. For other setups (sim boxes, local farms, etc.), there may be better-suited solutions.

### Deployment Questions

**Q: How do I make this Repl available for others to use as a template?**

You have two options:

1. **Make it Public** (Recommended for sharing)
   - Click the visibility settings
   - Set to "Public"
   - Anyone can view and **Remix** your Repl to create their own copy
   - Your secrets remain private (never exposed)
   - Users get a fresh copy with their own database

2. **Publish as Template** (Optional)
   - Makes your Repl appear in Replit's template gallery
   - Same as public but with more visibility
   - Good for promoting to wider community

**For UNITYmdm**: Simply making it **public** is enough. Users can remix, configure their own Firebase/secrets, and deploy independently.

---

**Q: What if I don't have GitHub Actions? Can I still build APKs?**

Yes! You have options:

- **Option 1**: Use GitHub Actions (recommended, free, automated)
- **Option 2**: Build locally with Android Studio (manual, requires ~5GB download)
- **Option 3**: Ask a technical friend to build the APK for you once, then use UNITYmdm's built-in APK deployment for future updates

Most users choose GitHub Actions since it's 100% automated after initial 10-minute setup.

**Q: Will this work with my specific Android phone model?**

UNITYmdm works with **any Android 13+ device**, but some carrier-specific phones (Verizon, AT&T, etc.) have extra bloatware that may need customization:

- ‚úÖ **Tested extensively** on Orbic Joy 2 (Verizon)
- ‚úÖ **Community tested** on various Samsung, Motorola, and generic devices
- ü§ñ **Easy customization** - Ask Replit Agent: "Adapt the ADB script for AT&T phones"

The included ADB script disables 27+ common bloatware apps. If your phone has different bloatware, Replit Agent can adjust the script in seconds.

---

**Q: How much does it cost to run UNITYmdm long-term?**

**Monthly costs (100 devices)**:
- Replit Core: $20/month (includes $25 credits)
- Firebase: Free tier (sufficient for 100-500 devices)
- Total: **~$0-20/month** (credits often cover the cost)

**At scale (1000 devices)**:
- Replit Core: ~$50/month (boosted resources)
- External PostgreSQL: ~$25/month (Neon/Supabase)
- Firebase: Still free tier
- Total: **~$75/month**

Compare to commercial MDM: $3-10 **per device per month** = $3000-10,000/month for 1000 devices!

**Q: What happens if my Repl goes down or I lose data?**

Replit provides:
- ‚úÖ **Automatic backups** - Your entire Repl is version controlled
- ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL backups** - Replit backs up your database automatically
- ‚úÖ **Rollback support** - Restore to any previous checkpoint
- ‚úÖ **99.9% uptime** - Replit Core provides production-grade reliability

For additional safety:

- Keep your Firebase credentials backed up separately
- Fork your Repl occasionally as a snapshot

---

**Q: Can I migrate from UNITYmdm to another system later?**

Yes! UNITYmdm doesn't lock you in:

- üì§ **Export device data** - PostgreSQL database is accessible (standard SQL)
- üîì **Open source** - MIT License allows any use
- üì± **Standard Android** - No proprietary device modifications
- üîÑ **Easy unenrollment** - Devices can be factory reset or enrolled elsewhere

You own all your data and devices.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How does the remote APK deployment work without USB?**

1. You upload an APK to the dashboard
2. Click "Deploy" and select target devices
3. UNITYmdm sends FCM push notification to devices
4. Devices download APK from your backend server
5. Android's Device Owner API installs silently (no user interaction)
6. Dashboard shows real-time progress

All over the internet - no cables required!

**Q: What's the difference between QR code and ADB enrollment?**

| Method | Best For | Setup Time | Requires |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| **QR Code** | Quick individual enrollments **(Not recommended - Can't enabled DeviceOwnerMode)** | 30 seconds | WiFi only |
| **ADB Script** | Bulk enrollment, Device Owner mode | ~15secs | USB cable + ADB |

**QR Code**: Fast for 1-5 devices, but can't enable Device Owner mode (needed for silent app installs).

**ADB Script**: Recommended enrollment method - enables full Device Owner privileges, disables bloatware, and configures battery optimization automatically. Required for production deployments.

---

**Q: How do I get support if something breaks?**

1. **Check logs** - Dashboard shows device errors and heartbeat status
2. **Ask Replit Agent** - It has full context of your deployment and can debug issues
3. **Review documentation** - [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) and [replit.md](replit.md) cover common issues
4. **Open an issue** - Describe your problem and we'll help troubleshoot (feel free to DM Serg on TG and I'll do my best to help, but AI is a **lot** smarter than I am :D 
5. **Community support** - Other UNITYmdm users may have solved similar problems

Most issues are solved in minutes with Replit Agent's help!
