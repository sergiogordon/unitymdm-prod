# Service Monitoring Implementation Status

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Backend Database Schema (✅ DONE)
- Added `monitored_threshold_min` (int, default 10) to Device model
- Added `monitor_enabled` (bool, default True) to Device model
- Added index on `(monitor_enabled, monitored_package)` for efficient queries
- Added service monitoring fields to DeviceLastStatus:
  - `service_up` (bool, nullable)
  - `monitored_foreground_recent_s` (int, nullable)
  - `monitored_package` (string, nullable)
  - `monitored_threshold_min` (int, nullable)
- Added index on `(service_up, last_ts)` for service_down queries

### 2. Backend API Endpoints (✅ DONE)
- **GET `/admin/devices/{device_id}/monitoring`** - Get monitoring configuration
- **PATCH `/admin/devices/{device_id}/monitoring`** - Update monitoring configuration
- Updated **PATCH `/v1/devices/{device_id}/settings`** to handle new fields
- Added validation:
  - Package name format validation (regex)
  - Threshold clamped to 1-120 minutes
  - Structured logging for all monitoring updates

### 3. Heartbeat Payload & Processing (✅ DONE)
- Added `monitored_foreground_recent_s` field to HeartbeatPayload schema
- Implemented service up/down evaluator in heartbeat processing:
  - Evaluates service status based on foreground recency vs threshold
  - Fallback to Speedtest-specific signals for backward compatibility
  - Updates DeviceLastStatus with service monitoring data
  - Logs state transitions (service_down → service_up and vice versa)
  - Emits Prometheus metrics for service status

### 4. Alert System Integration (✅ DONE)
- Added `SERVICE_DOWN` condition to AlertCondition enum
- Implemented `evaluate_service_down()` method in AlertEvaluator:
  - Uses DeviceLastStatus for efficient querying
  - Tracks state transitions for alerts and recoveries
  - Supports cooldown and deduplication
- Updated Discord webhook to handle service_down alerts:
  - Custom embed formatting with service name, threshold, last foreground time
  - Recovery notifications
  - Roll-up alerts for mass service_down events
- Added observability:
  - Structured logs: `monitoring.evaluate`, `monitoring.service_down`, `monitoring.service_up`
  - Metrics: `service_up_devices` gauge

### 5. Enhanced Discord Alert Format (✅ DONE)
- Service name display (monitored_app_name)
- Package name display
- Last foreground time in minutes
- Configured threshold
- Link to device dashboard

## Remaining Tasks 📋

### 6. Android Agent Updates (✅ DONE)
**Location:** `android/app/src/main/java/com/nexmdm/`

**Completed Changes:**
1. ✅ Added UsageStatsManager integration in TelemetryCollector.kt
2. ✅ Updated HeartbeatPayload in DataModels.kt to include `monitored_foreground_recent_s`
3. ✅ Updated MonitorService.kt to call getMonitoredForegroundRecency() and include in heartbeat
4. ✅ PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS permission already declared in AndroidManifest.xml

**Implementation Details:**
- `TelemetryCollector.getMonitoredForegroundRecency(packageName)` queries UsageStatsManager
- Looks back 1 hour for app usage statistics
- Returns seconds since last foreground use, or null if unavailable
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- MonitorService sends this data in every heartbeat using prefs.speedtestPackage

### 7. Frontend - Monitoring Settings UI (✅ DONE)
**Location:** `frontend/components/device-monitoring-modal.tsx`

**Completed Changes:**
1. ✅ Created DeviceMonitoringModal component
2. ✅ Shows current service status (Up/Down/Unknown) and last foreground time
3. ✅ Enable/disable monitoring toggle
4. ✅ Package name input with validation hints
5. ✅ Display name input for Discord alerts
6. ✅ Threshold slider (1-120 minutes)
7. ✅ Save button that calls PATCH /admin/devices/{id}/monitoring

**Features:**
- Modal opens from settings button on each device row
- Shows real-time service status if monitoring is configured
- Validates threshold range (1-120 minutes)
- Refreshes device list on successful save

### 8. Frontend - Device List Service Status (✅ DONE)
**Location:** `frontend/components/devices-table.tsx`, `frontend/lib/mock-data.ts`, `frontend/lib/api-client.ts`

**Completed Changes:**
1. ✅ Added "Service" column showing monitored app name/package with status badge (Up/Down/Unknown)
2. ✅ Added last foreground time display (e.g., "15m")
3. ✅ Added Settings2 icon button to open monitoring modal for each device
4. ✅ Updated Device interface to include monitoring fields
5. ✅ Updated API transformDevice to map monitoring data from backend
6. ✅ Implemented search filters:
   - `service:down` - shows only devices with service down
   - `service:up` - shows only devices with service up
   - `service:unknown` - shows devices without monitoring or unknown status

**Visual Indicators:**
- ✅ Green badge for service UP
- ❌ Red badge for service DOWN
- ⚠️ Gray badge for UNKNOWN
- "Not configured" text for devices without monitoring

### 9. Discord Webhook Setup Documentation (✅ DONE)
**Location:** `docs/DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`

**Completed Content:**
1. ✅ Step-by-step Discord webhook creation instructions
2. ✅ How to add webhook URL to Replit Secrets
3. ✅ Testing instructions (Send Test Alert button)
4. ✅ Alert types documentation (offline, low_battery, unity_down, service_down)
5. ✅ Service monitoring configuration examples
6. ✅ Troubleshooting guide
7. ✅ Best practices and security notes
8. ✅ Environment variables reference

## Database Migration

Since new columns were added, you need to restart the server to create them automatically (SQLAlchemy will handle this):

```bash
# Backend will auto-create new columns on startup
# No manual migration needed
```

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Create/update device monitoring settings via API
- [ ] Send heartbeat with `monitored_foreground_recent_s = 700` (>10min) → triggers service_down
- [ ] Send heartbeat with `monitored_foreground_recent_s = 30` (<10min) → triggers recovery
- [ ] Verify Discord alert is sent on service_down
- [ ] Verify Discord recovery alert is sent on service_up
- [ ] Test cooldown (should not send duplicate alerts within 30 min)
- [ ] Test threshold changes (update from 10min to 5min, verify evaluation)
- [ ] Test monitoring disabled (no alerts when `monitor_enabled = false`)

### Frontend Testing (when implemented)
- [ ] Open device monitoring settings
- [ ] Update monitored package
- [ ] Change threshold from 10 to 5 minutes
- [ ] Toggle monitoring enabled/disabled
- [ ] View service status in device list
- [ ] Filter by `service:down`
- [ ] Verify last foreground time display

### Android Agent Testing (when implemented)
- [ ] Verify `monitored_foreground_recent_s` is sent in heartbeat
- [ ] Test with Speedtest package (should work)
- [ ] Test with Unity package (should work when switched)
- [ ] Test with app in foreground (should report low seconds)
- [ ] Test with app in background for 15min (should report ~900s)
- [ ] Handle missing PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS permission gracefully (send null)

## Environment Variables

### Existing (already configured)
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` - Discord webhook for alerts
- `ALERT_DEVICE_COOLDOWN_MIN` - Cooldown between alerts (default: 30)
- `ALERT_GLOBAL_CAP_PER_MIN` - Max alerts per minute (default: 60)

### New (optional, with defaults)
- `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` - Expected heartbeat interval (default: 300 = 5 minutes)
